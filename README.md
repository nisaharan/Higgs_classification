# Higgs_classification
The Higgs classification is accomplished through the utilization of algorithms to identify and categorize particles detected in high-energy physics experiments based on their properties and characteristics. Machine learning models are trained on large datasets of known Higgs boson events, allowing patterns to be learned and predictions to be made in order to distinguish Higgs bosons from other particles. When a particle is classified as 0 or 1, it typically represents the presence or absence of a Higgs boson.

In this case, the classification task revolves around determining whether a detected particle exhibits the characteristics and properties of a Higgs boson or not.
